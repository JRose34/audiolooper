This repo is in progress.  When finished, the Audio Looper will be designed for use with to be used with Raspberry Pi Pico in main.py.  At the same time, the modules should be useable for anyone who knows how to code drivers from USB or the sound card directly on Python.

The first edition of this should include the following features:

 - An audio stream bypass
 - A visual display
 - Audio layering
 - Start, stop, restart, pause, continue playback as a whole and for layer
 - Multiple audio inputs
 - Multiple footswitches
 - Adjustable output volume (overall) + layer volume
 - Audio bypass (for solo, etc)
